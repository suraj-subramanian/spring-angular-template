# spring-angular-template
 A simple starter template for projects that need to use Spring Boot and Angular with Gradle as build tool.
 
 Just clone. Run `gradle build` and `gradle bootRun` .
 
 The Angular project is under "src/main/webapp" folder. The output directory for angular build files is set to "dist/static" in angular.json file.
 The gradle build task will run the Angular build and copy the output to the resources folder.
